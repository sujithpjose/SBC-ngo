  Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
  at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
  to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
  editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
  in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
  and the like).
